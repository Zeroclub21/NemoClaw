# Customize the Sandbox Network Policy

Add, remove, or modify the endpoints that the sandbox is allowed to reach.
NemoClaw supports both static policy changes that persist across restarts and dynamic updates to a running sandbox.

## Prerequisites

- A running NemoClaw sandbox (for dynamic changes) or the NemoClaw source repository (for static changes).
- The OpenShell CLI on your `PATH`.

## Static Changes

Static changes modify the baseline policy file and take effect after the next migration.

### Edit the Policy File

Open `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/openclaw-sandbox.yaml` and add or modify endpoint entries.

Each entry in the `network` section defines an endpoint group with the following fields:

`endpoints`
: Host and port pairs that the sandbox can reach.

`binaries`
: Executables allowed to use this endpoint.

`rules`
: HTTP methods and paths that are permitted.

### Re-Run the Migration

Apply the updated policy by re-running the migration:

```console
$ openclaw nemoclaw migrate
```

The migration picks up the modified policy file and applies it to the sandbox.

### Verify the Policy

Check that the sandbox is running with the updated policy:

```console
$ openclaw nemoclaw status
```

## Dynamic Changes

Dynamic changes apply a policy update to a running sandbox without restarting it.

### Create a Policy File

Create a YAML file with the endpoints to add.
Follow the same format as the baseline policy in `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/openclaw-sandbox.yaml`.

### Apply the Policy

Use the OpenShell CLI to apply the policy update:

```console
$ openshell policy set <policy-file>
```

The change takes effect immediately.

### Scope of Dynamic Changes

Dynamic changes apply only to the current session.
When the sandbox stops, the running policy resets to the baseline defined in the policy file.
To make changes permanent, update the static policy file and re-run the migration.

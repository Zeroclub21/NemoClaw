# Set Up a Local NIM Service

Route inference to an NVIDIA NIM container running on your local network.
This profile keeps all inference on-premises while using the same models available through NVIDIA cloud.

## Prerequisites

- A running NemoClaw sandbox.
- Docker or a compatible container runtime.
- A GPU with enough VRAM for the target model.
- An NVIDIA NGC API key for pulling NIM container images.

## Pull and Start the NIM Container

Pull the NIM container image and start it on port 8000:

```console
$ docker run -d --gpus all \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    --name nim-service \
    nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:latest
```

Wait until the container logs show that the model is loaded and ready to serve requests.
Check the logs with the following command:

```console
$ docker logs -f nim-service
```

## Verify the NIM Service

Confirm that the NIM container is reachable:

```console
$ curl http://nim-service.local:8000/v1/models
```

If `nim-service.local` does not resolve, use the container IP address or configure DNS to resolve the hostname.

## Set the NIM API Key

Export the `NIM_API_KEY` environment variable.
The `nim-local` profile uses this variable to authenticate with the NIM service:

```console
$ export NIM_API_KEY=<your-nim-api-key>
```

## Switch to the NIM Provider

Set the active inference provider to `nim-local`:

```console
$ openshell inference set --provider nim-local --model nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b
```

The change takes effect immediately.
No sandbox restart is required.

## Verify Inference Routing

Check the sandbox status to confirm the active provider:

```console
$ openclaw nemoclaw status
```

The output should show `nim-local` as the active provider with the endpoint `nim-service.local:8000`.

## Network Policy

The sandbox network policy includes a `nim_service` entry that allows traffic to `nim-service.local:8000`.
This entry is part of the baseline policy in `nemoclaw-blueprint/policies/openclaw-sandbox.yaml`.
No additional policy changes are required.

## Select the NIM Profile at Launch

To start a new sandbox with the `nim-local` profile, pass `--profile nim-local` during launch or migration:

```console
$ openclaw nemoclaw launch --profile nim-local
```

```console
$ openclaw nemoclaw migrate --profile nim-local
```
